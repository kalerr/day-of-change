        <p>
            This is my actual first step to improve myself. Hello, my name is <strong>I Gusti Ngurah Kaler Bramastha</strong>.I was a jobless, liar, and a very unproductive, lazy Indonesian kid. Here, i will write everything i will do to be a functioning
            member of the world. My biggest, only dream is to matter. I want humanity to acknowledge my existence, wether for a good cause, or even a bad cause. I dont want to die before changing something in humanity. And to do that, i must <strong>KEEP MOVING FOWARD</strong>
